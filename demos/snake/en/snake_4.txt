Now the snake is bounded to the game field but he is hungry!
We should allow him to eat some apples!

You may have noticed it as the red cube in the scene, if not visible try to set the canvas fullscreen using the button inside "View" in the Menu.

In order to pass this level you have to:
• complete the if-else inside the renderer by considering the z value of both the head and the apple
• in mesh tail set the head as a new child
• in mesh tail clear children in the function of clearing ("clearAction()")
• set also the z component of apple to a random integer between -40 and +40

To access the next level you have to collect 2 apples and crash against a boundary.

// Function levelCleared()
var collected_apples = 0;
function levelCleared() {
	let tail_len = mesh_tail.children.length;
	collected_apples = collected_apples > tail_len ? collected_apples : tail_len;
	if (collected_apples >= 2 && direction === "")
		return true;
	else
		return false;
}
