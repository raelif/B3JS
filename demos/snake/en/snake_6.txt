We are almost there!
The last quest for you is to forbid the snake to keep on moving, after he bit his tail!

You should guarantee the following:
â€¢ if the head has the same position as one of the elements of the tail, you call again "clearAction()"

In order to conlude the demo let the snake bite his tail.

// Function levelCleared()
function levelCleared() {
	return reason === "bite" && direction === "";
}
