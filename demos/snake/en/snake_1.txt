This is the first level of the demo building the game "Snake".
You can see the provided function "setWorld()", which creates the basic elements of the world.

You don't need to modify it but in order to clear this level, you have to:
• set the variable "direction" to the empty string ("")
• call the function "setWorld()" from the function panel
• add the "render with..."" block to the workspace together with its camera
• set the fps of the renderer to 30

The blocks should be connected, then click the button "Run".

// Function levelCleared()
function levelCleared() {
	if (direction === "") {
		let block = workspace.getBlocksByType('b3js_render_loop')[0];
		if (block && block.getInputTargetBlock('CAMERA') && block.getFieldValue('FPS') === '30')
			return true;
	}
	return false;
}
