The third level is very simple. The fact that the snake can go outside of the game's field is not good.
So the objective of this stage is to bound the motion to that interval.

A function named clearAction() has been added with the purpose of:
• resetting the direction to ""
• resetting the position of the head to {0, 0, 0}

Moreover the if-else inside the renderer has to be completed by:
• bounding also the z to the range of ± 40

To clear the level try to surpass 2 boundaries.

// Function levelCleared()
var was_different = false, count = 0;
function levelCleared() {
	if (direction !== "") {
		was_different = true;
	}
	if (was_different && direction === "") {
		count++;
		was_different = false;
	}
	return (count >= 2);
}
